+**What is their background, and thus their motivation?**  
 +Company man, fairly low down but the most senior. He wants things to remain the same and rejects change. Now dead, his messages reveal a growing paranoia and lack of faith in the company. 
 +
 +**What is their quest, their overall goal?**  
 +Now dead, he wants the protagonists (gardener and refugee cum business success) to find out who killed him. Medical conditons that cause death have now been eiminated and death would occur by suicide or murder only. The company celebrated the event of eradicating all but unnatural causes of death with a big party. He went there for the booze and became besotted with the idea of being murdered. 
 +
 +**What is their conflicting goal? (giving them a dual character)**  
 Though entirely resistant to change during his life, Stan now calls upon the two most progressive and radical members of staff to solve the mystery of his death. He does so because he cannot trust the purity of programming for lots of reasons.
 
 +
 +**How do they break stereotype?**  
 He was a symbol of company unity and stagnation during his life, but in death he has come to seek the help of those he once despised. 
 +
 +**How are they wacky and exaggerated?**  
So keen was he to show the superiority of the programmed world, he created a programmed natural world for his skeptical colleagues to walk around. He took them on virtual reality camping trips, fishing holidays and the like. The protagonists speculate that now, in death, he has come to live in his programmed natural world and it is from here that he is sending his messages.


 +**How are they interesting to know?**  
Seen as a fuddular dud during his life because of his obstinence and complete lack of worldliness, he is now the most important link between the natural and the artificial. Wouldn't yow like to know him?
 +
 +**How are they competent, effective and extraordinarily good at what they do?**  
 He created a fucking artificial natural world. Now he might live there. He's dead. Show some respect.
 
 +**How do they develop to become their polar opposite?**  
He did so, unseen in the text, shortly before his death. He died 7 days before the happenings of the text. He seeks the help of former foes.
 +
 +**How do they contrast sharply with their surroundings?**    
 He is the oldest of all company employees. And he is not very high up. Where others have sought promotion etc he has stayed back, becoming increasingly interested in his virtual reality natural world, and becoming increasingly upset at natural natural world happenings.
 +**Timeline**  
 No degree. One of the founding fathers of the company. Employed for his skills and friendship with long dead/absent co-founders. A growing resentment of new employees. Becomes very unpopular, with others seeing his comparatively low rank as a sign of shame, and him doubling down on his difficult personality in response to their ignorance.
 +**Appearance**  
 Handkercheif coming out of breast pocket. Worn elbows and knees on the one suit he owns. You can see the grey material of the one shirt he owns underneath. Smells of spearmint, because he rarely eats anything (he brushes his teeth in the morning, several times at work, and in the evening: it is his main form of sustenance). Trainers. Tie flipped over his shoulder: unkempt. Trousers too short. Belly never gets bigger.
